<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly Wynne is a local Austin fashion brand founded in 2012 by designer Kelly Wynne Ferguson. She created and launched her first line of handbags in the spring of 2013 and has been #wynning ever since. Kelly began her professional career in public relations, but her lifelong dream and passion for design stayed at the forefront of her mind. She was searching for unique printed leather handbags with an exotic look and feel that wouldn’t break the bank. Kelly knew she had found a missing niche in the market, but with minimal experience in the industry, she needed encouragement and direction on where to begin. Her career mentor pushed her to vocalize this dream by asking the simplest question. “If you could do anything, anything at all… if money wasn’t an issue, the sky was the limit… what would it be?” Kelly finally blurted out, “I just want to design handbags!” Verbally acknowledging her passion for the first time gave her the momentum to take the next step in turning her vision into a reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly Wynne is known for bold, printed leather and unique use of color and texture. Kelly custom designs her signature multi-colored python prints, releasing inspiring new colorways every season. Each collection is produced with limited quantities, giving the customer a sense of exclusivity.</span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly designs obtainable luxury with the customer in mind, providing versatility and functionality while maintaining a chic and classic style for the modern working woman…. making Kelly Wynne #baggoals!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fall of 2017, Kelly Wynne launched one of the most recognizable high end clear bags on the market along with the announcement of the new NCAA and NFL clear bag policy. With so many football loving customers, Kelly was determined to design a clear bag that does not cramp your style! Since then the Clear Mingle Mingle Mini has become one of the best selling items making it the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">clear wynner</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One year later, Nordstrom selected Kelly Wynne as their premier clear bag line to sell on </span><a href="http://www.nordstrom.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.nordstrom.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the beginning, Kelly Wynne has supported non-profit organizations across the U.S. by donating handbags and one-of-a-kind pieces to silent auctions, but Kelly has always longed to do more. In September 2016, we began our "Dare to Donate" program, giving us a more meaningful way to touch our community. This passion to make an impact started out with giveback events highlighting a different organization each month. On our 6th year anniversary, we turned this passion into a much bigger impact. As of April 2019, we now donate $5 from every purchase toward sponsoring a sex trafficking survivor to attend The Refuge Ranch.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly spends much of her time mentoring and speaking to different groups of women, as a passion of hers is to encourage and support others to have the confidence to do what they love, and love what they do! A big factor in Kelly’s success has been from the empowerment she has gained from other “boss ladies” in her life. She truly believes that empowered women empower women which is why Kelly is vulnerable in sharing her failures and successes. Anyone can be a boss lady if you ask Kelly; they may just need a little bit of push. “You don’t have to own a company to be a boss lady, you just have to own your life.” - Kelly Wynne Ferguson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With continued growth and love for the brand across the nation, Kelly Wynne continues to “wynnespire” women to “Dare to WYNNE” in all aspects of life! </span></p>
